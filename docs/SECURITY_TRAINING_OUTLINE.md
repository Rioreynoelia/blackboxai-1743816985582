```

### 3. Access Security
```javascript
// Password policy validation
function validatePassword(password) {
  const minLength = 12;
  const hasUpper = /[A-Z]/.test(password);
  const hasLower = /[a-z]/.test(password);
  const hasNumber = /\d/.test(password);
  const hasSpecial = /[!@#$%^&*]/.test(password);
  
  return password.length >= minLength && 
         hasUpper && hasLower && 
         hasNumber && hasSpecial;
}
```

## Delivery & Evaluation

### Training Methods
| Format | Frequency | Duration | Completion Goal |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| E-learning | Annual | 1 hour | 100% completion |
| Phishing Tests | Quarterly | N/A | <5% click rate |
| Workshops | Biannual | 2 hours | 90% attendance |

### Metrics Dashboard
```sql
SELECT 
  department,
  AVG(quiz_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN phish_reported THEN 1 END) as reports,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN phish_clicked THEN 1 END) as clicks
FROM security_training
GROUP BY department;
```
