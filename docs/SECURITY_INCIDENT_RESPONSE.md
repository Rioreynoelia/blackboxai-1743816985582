# Demplot Security Incident Response Plan

## Incident Classification
| Severity | Impact | Response Timeline |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Critical | Production systems compromised | Immediate (24/7) |
| High     | Sensitive data exposure | 1 hour |
| Medium   | System vulnerability | 4 hours |
| Low      | Configuration issues | Next business day |

## Response Workflow

### 1. Identification
```bash
# Check for breaches
node scripts/checkBreaches.js

# Audit logs
grep -E 'FAILED_LOGIN|UNAUTHORIZED' logs/auth.log
```

### 2. Containment
**Immediate Actions**:
- Isolate affected servers
- Disable compromised accounts
- Preserve forensic evidence

```bash
# Isolate server
node scripts/isolateServer.js <ip>

# Rotate credentials
node scripts/rotateCredentials.js --all
```

### 3. Eradication
**Remediation Steps**:
1. Apply security patches
2. Remove malicious code
3. Rebuild compromised systems

### 4. Recovery
**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Penetration testing complete
- [ ] Monitoring enhanced
- [ ] Credentials rotated

## Communication Protocol
1. **Internal**:
   - Security team notified immediately
   - Executives briefed within 1 hour

2. **External**:
   - Legal approval required
   - Regulators notified per policy
   - Customers informed if data breached

## Forensic Procedures
**Evidence Collection**:
```bash
# Capture system state
node scripts/captureEvidence.js --full

# Preserve logs
tar -czvf forensic_evidence.tar.gz /var/log/
```

**Chain of Custody**:
1. Document all access
2. Cryptographic hashes of evidence
3. Secure storage

## Post-Incident Review
1. **Root Cause Analysis** within 72 hours
2. **Process Improvements** documented
3. **Runbook Updates** completed
4. **Team Training** scheduled

## Prevention Measures
- Monthly security audits
- Quarterly penetration tests
- Continuous vulnerability scanning
