# Demplot

Demplot is a web application built with Node.js and Express for managing various functionalities such as user authentication, geographic information systems (GIS), product data, and weather information. It integrates with external services like Twilio for phone verification and OpenWeatherMap for weather data.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes MongoDB for data storage, and implements various middleware and logging features to enhance functionality and security. It also provides a health check endpoint and API documentation for easy navigation of the services.

## Installation

To install and set up Demplot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/demplot.git
   cd demplot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project following the sample below:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/demplot
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
   TWILIO_VERIFY_SID=your_verify_service
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_key
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Ensure MongoDB and Twilio accounts are set up with the necessary configurations as per the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access the health check at `http://localhost:3000/health` and API documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.

## Features
